# Real-Time-Sign-Detection
The Real Time Sign Detection project uses computer vision and machine learning to recognize alphabetic hand gestures in real-time. It captures gestures via webcam, processes the images, and translates them into corresponding letters. This aids communication for those with hearing and speech impairments.
