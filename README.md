# Real-Time-Sign-Detection
The Real Time Sign Detection project uses computer vision and machine learning to recognize alphabetic hand gestures in real-time. It captures gestures via webcam, processes the images, and translates them into corresponding letters. This aids communication for those with hearing and speech impairments.

Features:-
Real-time detection: The system can capture and process hand gestures in real-time, providing instant feedback.
Alphabet recognition: Detects and recognizes hand gestures representing individual alphabet letters.
User-friendly interface: Easy to use interface for capturing hand gestures and displaying recognized letters.
Machine learning model: Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to accurately recognize and classify hand gestures.
Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language for developing the application.
OpenCV: For real-time image capturing and processing.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the machine learning model.
Flask: To create a web-based interface for the application.
NumPy and Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
